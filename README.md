# Weather App

### Inspiration 
When I started this project I wanted to learn how to use following things:

<ul>
  <li>Ajax</li>
  <li>API</li>
  <li>Vanilla JS</li>
</ul>

### Description 
This application allows you to view the weather in your city. The following options are provided:

<ul>
  <li>View current weather</li>
  <li>View weather by hour</li>
  <li>View the weather for the week</li>
  <li>View detailed weather data</li>
  <li>Data caching</li>
  <li>Choose the city yourself</li>
  <li>Adding cards of other cities</li>
</ul>
    
### Stack

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as IDE</li>
  <li>Vanilla JS</li>
  <li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> to make structure of layout</li>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for version control</li>
  <li><a href="https://vitejs.dev">Vite</a> as build tool</li>
</ul>

### API

<ul>
  <li>To get forecast data I used <a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Open-meteo</a></li>
  <li>To get coordinations I used <a href="https://geocode.maps.co/">Geocode</a></li>
<ul>

### Summary
The project has been finalized due to the achievement of the objective.
Objectively it still has a lot of bugs, but I decided to move to another project due to the fact that this project is hard to scale due to bugs in the beginning, it's slow due to Vanilla Js, and I'm also bored with it since I've been doing it for a month now
